    <p class="content">About four hours after she became the youngest woman ever to take a company public, two hours after Bumble’s soaring stock price made her a billionaire, and 45 minutes after cutting into a honeycomb-shaped cake and kicking off her yellow heels,
         Whitney Wolfe Herd sat on her pink velvet couch in her canary-colored office and blinked back tears. Here she was,
          one of the top female CEOs in tech, a founder who had created one of the largest dating apps in the world out of
           the ashes of her own humiliation. Yet none of it felt like she thought it would. Part of it was the stress of the initial public offering (IPO), a moment she had imagined for so long that it felt almost as surreal as her wedding day. But Wolfe Herd, 31, was also annoyed at the way her story was being told. Her success at Bumble, billed as the dating app where women “make the first move,” had cast her as the Kill Bill of the tech world: a yellow-clad woman seeking vengeance after men tried to bury her. Much of the coverage focused on her experience years ago as a co-founder at the dating app Tinder, where Wolfe Herd was allegedly harassed by an executive who was also her boyfriend, got dumped and ousted from the company, and went on to sue for sexual harassment. On the day she was supposed to be talking about her empire, Wolfe Herd found herself describing the men she had endured before building it.

           “I don’t need to justify myself anymore. I’m f-cking done,” she says, leaning back against a cardboard placard of the company’s brand-new stock listing, BMBL, which had just jumped 63% to $70 a share within hours of the Feb. 11 IPO. “Why am I cleaning up somebody else’s drama? Women are always cleaning up somebody else’s mess.”
           
           Except that mess–her history of toxic relationships, the misogyny of tech–is exactly why Bumble exists. It’s why Wolfe Herd designed the app so only women can send the first message when users match on the platform. In an online dating landscape where women–and particularly women of color–are routinely bullied and harassed, Wolfe Herd set out to build the closest thing to a safe space for digital romance. “Honestly, my ambition comes from abusive relationships,” Wolfe Herd told me the night before the IPO, in her suite at Austin’s Commodore Perry Estate. “I’ve never had this healthy male relationship until I created it. I engineered an ecosystem of healthy male relationships in my life.”

           How to Stay Ahead of Emerging Cyberthreats in 2022
           BY TRELLIX
           
           Wolfe Herd occupies the middle of a Venn diagram of the ongoing national reckoning with sexual
            harassment and the push to regulate human behavior on the Internet. She’s one of the last millennial
             women CEOs standing after the backlash to “girl boss” feminism. And at a moment when most tech executives 
             are making excuses for why they can’t be held responsible for the behavior on their platforms, Wolfe Herd 
             is the rare tech titan who sees her company as a tool for shaping how people behave, online and off.By that February morning in Austin, Bumble was a dating app, a business-networking bazaar and a friend-finding tool that has engineered 8.6 billion connections among tens of millions of users in 237 countries since 2014. It employs more than 420 “brand ambassadors” across more than 100 college campuses and is planning to open Bumble-themed coffee shops after the pandemic. A month after the IPO, it’s valued at more than $14 billion, and last year it hauled in $582 million in revenue with a 26% profit margin. Wolfe Herd once told me she wanted Bumble to be “Facebook, but for people who don’t know each other yet.”

             Like some other dating apps, the company makes its profit through subscriptions and in-app purchases that allow users to boost the reach of their profiles, extend the clock on their matches (most expire after 24 hours) and go back to options they might have missed. But what Bumble is really selling is a sense of control over the mysterious alchemy of human relationships.
             
             Wolfe Herd sees Bumble less as a dating app, a social platform or a tech company than as a brand. It’s the word that she uses the most when talking about Bumble, and it’s the word that crops up most frequently in conversations with employees and executives. “Whitney is a big believer that branding is everything,” says Alex Williamson, Wolfe Herd’s sorority sister and best friend, and Bumble’s former chief brand officer.
             
             Bumble’s brand is deeply embedded in the Empowerment Industrial Complex. More youthful than “Lean In,” less litigious than “Time’s Up,” Bumble represents a type of friendly Sadie Hawkins feminism that is more about feeling powerful than wielding power. And yet, amid a reckoning over racial justice, the movement for women’s empowerment–which has historically been focused on the empowerment of affluent white women–is itself at a crossroads. After Donald Trump, after COVID-19, much of its messaging sounds stale and exclusive in the face of so many other massive inequalities.
             
             “I think empowerment has probably commercially been taken advantage of, the word itself, and we’re probably part of that,” Wolfe Herd says. “We started saying this before Time’s Up, before #MeToo–we were saying these things before our peers. Every single company right now is doing ‘girl power’ and ‘the future is female.'” She knows that keeping her brand relevant means expanding her vision for the company beyond the women whom she imagined when she first launched the app. And of course, she knows how to brand this too. “I’m so happy to own our shortcomings,” she says. “Because that’s the only way we’re ever going to get better.”

             In the five years I have been interviewing her, Wolfe Herd has never quite developed that hard and shiny exterior so many successful people get, repeating practiced lines like human press releases. She has a juicy but frustrating habit of saying, “O.K., but this is super off the record” before sharing some deep personal secret. As Jack Dorsey tried to “biohack” himself and Elon Musk named himself the “techno king” of Tesla, Wolfe Herd spent the night before her IPO making calls while lying on a towel on her hotel-room floor, apologizing for interrupting her lawyers and bankers at bath time. When her chief of staff told her that college girls now take pictures near her photo in the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority house at Southern Methodist University (SMU), Wolfe Herd gasped. “With my skinny eyebrows,” she says, “that I overplucked?” She is like the Elle Woods of tech entrepreneurs.
             
             Online dating can be a miserable experience in the best of environments–it’s hard to make genuine connections inspired by an algorithmic match–and it’s not clear Bumble leads to deeper or more meaningful relationships than other apps. (The company says it hosted 112 million “good chats” in 2020, defined as a conversation with 10 or more back-and-forths, among other metrics.) “The brand is better than the product right now,” says Wolfe Herd–a startling admission for the CEO of a 6-year-old startup. “But that’s gonna change.”
             
             Bumble has been criticized as a Tinder spin-off and a feminist marketing ploy. Some former employees say the company felt like a sorority in the early days. Bumble’s former majority owner Andrey Andreev, the billionaire founder of the European dating app Badoo, came under fire after Forbes magazine published accounts from 13 ex-employees detailing a misogynistic culture at Badoo’s London headquarters.
             
             And yet, in a world scarred by the radical liberty of the Internet–where truth is in the eye
              of the beholder, hate speech flourishes, and women are routinely harassed–Bumble is one of the
               few tech companies that seems to care more about safety than freedom. It is the first major social
                platform to embrace behavioral guardrails and content moderation as part of its business model.
                 “We would have blocked Donald Trump years ago if he used our product,” Wolfe Herd says. (Her husband,
                  oil heir Michael Herd, maxed out donations to Trump in 2016 and 2017. A spokesman says Herd has not
                   supported Trump in years, and “his views have evolved considerably since then.”)I ask Wolfe Herd why one of the only billionaire tech founders who’s a woman also happens to be one of the only ones who believes that behavior on her platform is her responsibility. “I don’t think it’s a coincidence,” she says.

                   The Bumble headquarters in Austin is nicknamed the Hive. The building is bright yellow, and nearly everything inside is some shade of goldenrod or canary or banana. The phone booth and bookshelves and pantry are all shaped like honeycombs, and the walls are full of puns like Bee Kind. It looks more like a concept than an office, a workplace for people whose job includes posting pictures of their workplace.
                   
                   On the morning she took her company public, Wolfe Herd approached a Nasdaq lectern wearing a pineapple-colored suit on loan from Stella McCartney and yellow Manolo Blahniks. She gave the speech she had practiced while lying on her hotel room floor the night before, promising to “try and make the Internet a kinder, more accountable place.” Suddenly her husband handed her their 18-month-old son, Bobby, who was wearing a miniature dark turtleneck and tiny jeans, like a Steve Jobs doll. Bobby started fidgeting and pulling at her hair. The team was lined up behind her, wearing yellow, clapping in unison, as Bobby picked this instant to scratch at her face, and her smile froze because she was thinking that her darling baby boy was about to poke her eye out at the exact second she took her company public. But then the bell rang, and yellow balloons and confetti dropped from the sky.
                   
                   Almost immediately, Wolfe Herd changed her clothes. “My pants are too tight,” she says (and honestly, whose aren’t these days?). She had willed all this to fruition on sheer force of vision, but she was not at peace. “I have a degree of imposter syndrome,” she says. “On a day like today, when everyone’s celebrating, I’m still kind of looking over my shoulder, like, we have to do more.”
                   
                   Other tech founders got their starts hunched over keyboards in darkened Ivy League dorm rooms, but Wolfe Herd has never written a line of code. Growing up in Salt Lake City, she was obsessed with Walt Disney. It wasn’t necessarily a princess fixation; it was his world-making that appealed to her. “I just think she wanted the world to be a perfect world,” says her mother, Kelly Vincent, who worked in art museums before Wolfe Herd was born.
                   
                   
                   Wolfe Herd’s father was in the sporting-goods business, and Wolfe Herd and her younger sister spent much of their childhoods skiing and camping. The Wolfe family wasn’t Mormon, but the religion’s conservative values permeated their community. “Women are looked at so differently here,” says Wolfe Herd’s childhood friend Liddy Huntsman, the daughter of former Utah governor Jon Huntsman. “The male is who you obey.”
                   
                   Wolfe Herd and her friends say they weren’t the popular girls, but of course, that’s what popular girls would say. According to friends and family, her high school years were notable primarily for an abusive boyfriend she dated on and off. It was “one of the most horrific relationships that I’ve ever seen,” says Huntsman. One friend recalls hearing him and his friends referring to Wolfe Herd and her mother and sister as “c-nts.” Wolfe Herd’s mother alleges he threw a watch at her head at a family birthday party; Vincent also recalls going to the boyfriend’s house after being told he had threatened Wolfe Herd with a gun. “I experienced severe emotional abuse from my high school boyfriend during my really formative years, and it stripped me down to nothing,” says Wolfe Herd. “It showed me a very dark side of relationships, and it helped inform my understanding of what was wrong with gender dynamics.” (Her ex-boyfriend told TIME the claims are “absurd,” “false” and “fictitious.” TIME is withholding the name of the ex-boyfriend at her request, and because he was not convicted of a crime.)
                   
                   Friends say the experience was formative. “You see people do wonderful things and you think, What really pushed them?” says Huntsman. “For Whitney, something that happened to her so early in her life that was really traumatizing has been the reason Bumble has been what it is today.”
                   
                   After friends and family pushed her to leave Utah to escape her ex, Wolfe Herd ended up at SMU, near Dallas. On one of her first days of school, she met Williamson, who was working at a boutique near campus. They hit it off, and Williamson helped Wolfe Herd join her sorority, Kappa Kappa Gamma. The process of rushing “was a lot like dating,” Williamson says. “It was a great way to meet people and a great way to network.” On a campus like SMU, Greek life was a platform for building connections–dates, friends, future business partners. But at its core, a sorority is a brand: a constellation of events and T-shirts and rules, a set of expectations around how to look and how to behave and whom to hang out with, all designed to tell the world what kind of girl you are.
                   
                   
                   After graduating in 2011 with a degree in international studies, Wolfe Herd got a job in Los Angeles working for a tiny company called Cardify, an app that allowed users to swipe through retail loyalty cards. Some Cardify employees then applied the swipe mechanism to dating and started Tinder, and Wolfe Herd became a co-founder focused on marketing. Her duties involved touring college campuses to advertise the app with pizza parties and free thongs and flyers. Around the same time, she began dating another co-founder, Justin Mateen.
                   
                   But things at Tinder went sour. Her relationship with Mateen unraveled, which meant her position at the company became precarious. One former Tinder employee recalls executives telling Wolfe Herd to “shut up,” demanding she fetch breakfast and discussing her breast size in meetings when she wasn’t there. Another friend recalls that Wolfe Herd was “slut-shamed” at the office and once had someone spit in her face at a party. (Wolfe Herd is prohibited from commenting about her experience at Tinder because of a reported settlement, for $1 million plus stock, from a sexual harassment lawsuit she filed against the company in 2014, in which she alleged that Mateen called her a “whore” at a meeting. Asked about the allegations, a Tinder spokesperson noted that every executive named in the lawsuit has left the company.)
                   
                   After Wolfe Herd left Tinder, she set out to “prove everybody wrong,” says Williamson. “To prove that she was the person that did the marketing behind Tinder, she did help the company grow, and all that was being stripped from her. She did it once, and she’ll do it again, better.”
                   
                   In the beginning, Bumble was only a brand. At 24, branding was the thing Wolfe Herd knew best.
                   
                   At first, scarred by the online harassment she endured after the Tinder blowup, Wolfe Herd wanted 
                   to make an app where women could give each other compliments. But then Andreev approached her with
                    an idea to start a dating app; Wolfe Herd said she would only do it if women could be in control.
                     She hired Caroline Roche, a fellow sorority girl at SMU, and together they spent their weekends 
                     traveling to Texas campuses, bringing free yellow Hanky Panky underwear to the sororities and free
                      beer to the fraternities, telling the fraternity brothers that all the girls were looking for their
                       next formal dates on Bumble. She showed up at SMU’s homecoming weekend with Bumble T-shirts and 
                       Bumble balloons. She branded Bumble as a friendlier dating app for women. The app’s central 
                       feature is that only women can initiate a conversation in heterosexual matches, sparing users 
                       from the spamming that women often endure on other sites.Wolfe Herd and Roche worked mostly out of Roche’s parents’ extra bedroom in Austin, and spent most weekends packing Roche’s dad’s car full of pizzas to drop off at various Greek houses. Soon, they moved the company into a small two-bedroom apartment, where the bathtub was filled with Bumble merchandise.

                       At this point, the app was still being built. “We started marketing Bumble before we had any sort of product,” says Roche. “And Whitney always said, ‘It’s a lifestyle brand, it’s a lifestyle brand. It’s a lifestyle brand.’ That’s what we leaned into.”
                       
                       The company had a strong sorority vibe, four early employees say. Wolfe Herd’s first employees were her friends, since she had trouble hiring because of the “scarlet letter” after the Tinder lawsuit; that meant some early employees felt that the company was dominated by privileged, white sorority sisters. It wasn’t just that the company was homogenous; the “nicer” dating app wasn’t always a nice place to work. “There was a lot of internal politics; there was a lot of gossip,” says one former employee. “Everybody was nice to me until they weren’t.”
                       
                       Wolfe Herd acknowledges that the early company could be cliquey, and says she tried hard to address the gossipy 
                       culture. She made a “72-hour rule” to force employees to resolve all interpersonal disputes within that time 
                       frame to prevent backstabbing and simmering grudges. But she also says much of it was out of her control. “I’m not Mother Teresa,” she says.
                       
                       Several former employees complained that unlike at many startups, some early Bumble employees didn’t get equity in the company. (Wolfe Herd says that her deal structure with Andreev meant that giving up more equity would mean sacrificing her board seat. A Bumble representative followed up to say every current employee has equity in the company.) Other critics noted that her partnership with Andreev meant that Wolfe Herd never faced the fundraising challenges most female CEOs are forced to navigate.
                       
                       But many employees recall a CEO who strove to be thoughtful, even during the difficult early days of a startup. Sarah Mick, a former chief creative officer at Bumble who also worked with Wolfe Herd at Tinder, recalls that she worried that a company pool party would be “uncomfortable” for her, because she was overweight at the time and there wasn’t a swimsuit that fit her. (Wolfe Herd was not at the party.) She thought she might be judged, but she was pleasantly surprised. “It was really that I expected it to be that way, and when I arrived, it wasn’t,” she says. On another occasion, Wolfe Herd surprised her with a pair of Valentino heels that arrived at her door, because she knew Mick loved shoes. “It made me feel cared for and actually appreciated,” Mick says.
                       
                       
                       There were growing pains.”We had so much negative feedback about the app,” says a former employee, who worked there for more than two years in the early days of the company and recalled problems with the user interface. “But all [Wolfe Herd] cared about was the brand.”
                       
                       Part of her vision for that brand was to take Bumble beyond the realm of dating. Wolfe Herd didn’t want the company to be just a women-centric version of Tinder; she wanted Bumble to be a platform for meeting every type of person you might want in your life. In 2016, the company launched Bumble BFF, which allowed people to use the app to make platonic friendships. When I tried the feature, I found it full of people whose profiles said they had just moved to a new city, or were looking for yoga buddies, or wanted to meet fellow dog owners.
                       
                       The following year brought the launch of Bumble Bizz, designed to help people match with potential business contacts. In 2019, as part of its push to ban unsolicited lewd photos, the company lobbied the Texas legislature to pass a bill that imposed a $500 fine on anyone who sent obscene images without consent. Bumble introduced identity verification to weed out trolls, banned guns in photos, and rolled out new guidelines around harassment and body shaming.
                       
                       Wolfe Herd knows changing behavior on one app is only a small part of a larger cultural shift. “Do I think by a woman making the first move on Bumble we’re going to solve every women’s issue
                        around the world? No,” says Wolfe Herd. “Do I think it’s a good first step to recalibrate an age-old system 
                        that sets us all up for failure, men and women? Yes. Because the Internet has megapower to shift behavior–if
                         you use it for good.”
                       
                       Wolfe Herd wants to regulate behavior on her platform the way it’s regulated offline.
                        “If you go in the street right now and take your clothes off in the middle of the road,
                         you’re going to jail,” she says. “You get naked on the Internet right now, chances are you’ll be fine.”
                       
                       
                       “We can fix it,” she continues, before backtracking: “Not fix it, but–there could be a consequence.”
                       
                       In 2020, Bumble logged more than 880,000 incidents that violated user guidelines,
                        according to a company representative, which resulted in consequences ranging from
                         written warnings to temporary suspensions to users being permanently blocked 
                         from the platform. (A Bumble representative, citing legal reasons, declined to provide
                          a breakdown of which types of punishments were implemented for which infractions, but 
                          said it has banned far more than 880,000 people from the platform overall.) The company
                           uses artificial-intelligence programs to scan for violations like hate speech, even when no users report the behavior. The goal is to clean up the platform without relying on user reports, and to identify people who are likely to behave badly before they actually do it. For example, the AI scans profiles for images of guns and swastikas and has been trained to recognize at least 700 “stop words” (including words like suicide and dozens of racial slurs) inside of chats, according to Miles Norris, Bumble’s chief product officer. Each time a violation is reported by the algorithm, Norris says, it gets referred to a team of 2,000 human moderators who decide whether the behavior merits blocking.
                       
                       The company’s latest big push is to address body shaming by imposing a ban on “unsolicited and derogatory comments made about someone’s appearance, body shape, size or health.” I decided to put its efforts to the test
                       
                       If you are looking for a fun couple’s-night activity, I recommend standing over your
                        husband’s shoulder and watching him swipe through hundreds of women on Bumble who aren’t you.
                       
                       Shortly after I returned from visiting Wolfe Herd in Austin, I made my husband Mark 
                       download the app. I wanted to see how long it would take Bumble to match me with the
                        person I had already married–and whether the behavioral guardrails it touts actually worked.
                       
                       I found him in about a dozen swipes. But, true to some users’ complaints, the women-centric dating
                        app seemed absolutely packed with women. Mark swiped past two old roommates, three women he knew 
                        from work, and two women with my exact name and age. His hand was starting to hurt. He swiped past
                         an endless stream of women who had branded themselves as instantly recognizable “types”–Yoga
                          Master, Dog Lover, Girl Who Loves Cocktails, Girl Who Loves to Hike, Girl Who Has Been 
                          to Rome. It took him almost two days to find me.When he did, I immediately started harassing him. “I don’t date fat guys,” I wrote to my husband. “Ur ugly.” Mark reported me for “rude or abusive behavior.”

                          Trap baited, I signed off Bumble and read an article about how white supremacists use Facebook to recruit new members. I read a Pew study about how 41% of Americans say they have personally experienced online harassment and that 25% have experienced “severe” online harassment, up 10 points since 2014.
                          
                          Nine hours later, I was blocked.
                          
                          Once upon a time, brands were the things that got you to buy a particular car, or try a particular soap, or feed your kid Heinz baked beans. The brand was in service of the product. But in the oversaturated, superadvertised, hypermarketed attention economy, branding has slipped the bounds of advertising and become something broader, more amorphous–a statement of how to be, not just what to buy. It’s about chasing a perfectible, promotable existence.
                          
                          The Kardashian empire is rooted in branding. An entire ecosystem of brand influencers is raking in billions on Instagram and TikTok. Trump rode branding to the pinnacle of American politics. Why should tech be any different?
                          
                          Sitting in her office on the morning of the IPO, I asked Wolfe Herd which company she compares hers to most. I thought she would say Facebook, the behemoth of digital socializing. Instead, true to her old childhood fascination, she said she wanted Bumble to one day be like Disney. “There’s a visceral sentiment that lives within these few brands in the world,” she explained. “And sometimes their products aren’t that great. There are some Disney movies that tank and they suck. But that brand makes you feel something, right?”
                          
                          The larger question, she says, is: “Do you wake up the next day feeling like you don’t have to 
                          take sh-t from that jerk anymore?”
                          
                          This feeling is her product. This is her car, her soap, her baked beans. More than relationships
                          , or friendships, or in-app purchases, Wolfe Herd is selling the feeling of power to the 
                          powerless, a sense of order in an online universe that so frequently seems lawless. That
                           means visualizing a better Internet, and promoting a safer version of it. And even if 
                           that idealized online landscape doesn’t exist yet, Wolfe Herd will brand it into existence.
                            What, like it’s hard?

         <p class="content">When Zoom CEO Eric Yuan hired Kelly Steckelberg to be his company's first CFO in 2017, he had his sights set on going public and needed an experienced hand to help him prepare for and manage the IPO. He got that. But he also got a former CEO whose experience on the strategic side of running a company made her the ideal partner to manage Zoom's explosive pandemic-led growth.

            "We didn't hire Kelly because we are going to go public," Yuan told the Silicon Valley Business Journal at the time. "It's more to help us grow our business."
            
            Yuan and Steckelberg worked together at WebEx, the video conferencing platform Cisco bought in 2007. For all of WebEx's promise, Yuan said, it was too hard for people to use. That led him and other engineers to leave and build from scratch what they hoped would be a reliable, user-friendly platform: Zoom.

            Steckelberg, who was finance chief and then CEO of dating app Zoosk after she left WebEx, was the natural choice to join her former colleagues.
            
            "Having the opportunity to be CFO at Zoom was something I just couldn't pass up," she said.
            
            For her role managing a company that, because of the pandemic, grew 355% over two quarters and became a household name, Steckelberg is CFO Dive's CFO of the Year.
            
            "Kelly and her team have done a tremendous job," says Ryan Koontz, who follows Zoom as managing director of Rosenblatt Securities. "She's an integral part of the machine there."
            
            Empowering success
            Steckelberg brings two guiding principles to her role as CFO: Employees should think of the company's finances as their own, and they should understand how their role contributes to the company's success.
            
            "If you give employees the opportunity to understand how they fit in, most will rise to the occasion and do everything they can to help," she said. "Everybody wants to participate in the company's financial success."
            
            Steckelberg credits her three years as CEO of Zoosk with giving her organization-wide insight.
            
            "It gave me a much greater understanding of how marketing, engineering, and product development come together," she said. "If we're launching a product, what does that mean for needs that ripple across the whole organization? I'm more able to prompt people to think, if we're adding all this headcount over here, don't we need something on this side as well?"
            
            Zoosk was a popular dating app when Steckelberg joined it as finance chief in 2011, but it ran into trouble while preparing for an IPO in 2014. Its losses were mounting despite having 27 million users and $200 million in revenue.
            
            With critics saying the company was focusing too much on growth at the expense of profitability, the company canceled its IPO and Steckelberg was promoted to CEO. The job forced her to make tough calls, including laying off 15% of the staff and reducing marketing spend.
            
            "Reductions in force are the hardest decisions you have to make," she said.
            
            A key to the company's turnaround was her executive team's decision to change the direction of the product and eliminate features that would decrease its revenue in the short term.
            
            "That was a very difficult decision to make," she said. "It's absolutely counter-intuitive to everything you learn as a finance person. But two years later, our strategy really took hold."
            
            Managing growth
            Zoom was already a high-flying company when she left Zoosk in 2017, but the pandemic supercharged its growth in a way few businesses have experienced.
            
            "It just happened to be they were at the right place at the right time," Koontz said. "They literally accelerated about four years' worth of growth into two quarters. And there aren't too many types of products or services you can sell in the world that can actually produce that. Zoom is a verb now."
            
            Koontz credits Steckelberg and her team with managing the company's meteoric rise with the right mix of short- and long-term investment while executing an aggressive organization-wide hiring plan. The company has grown from about 700 employees to 4,000 in the last three years, and needs more, but the pandemic has slowed hiring.
            
            "I know they paid out bonuses to a lot of employees over the third quarter, during the pandemic, just for the workload these people had to incur because they literally couldn't hire fast enough," Koontz said.
            
            He praised the company's decision to open its two newest R&D centers in Arizona and Pennsylvania rather than in Silicon Valley or other technology hubs. "These are places where you can hire engineers," he said.
            
            The company's decision to add server capacity by partnering with Oracle, rather than building additional in-house data centers, is another smart move, because it provides the kind of flexibility that it can turn on and off as needed in the short-term.
            
            "Their margins took a little bit of a hit because they had to use public cloud instead of building their own infrastructure out in some places," he said. "You can basically order up the level of service you need on an hour-to-hour basis to handle your peak loads, so they're basically using public cloud to handle the peaks and to handle the surges in demand where they just aren't ready with their own infrastructure."
            
            "It gives us the ability to flex up and down as we need to going forward," Steckelberg said. "We're being thoughtful about not getting over-committed from a resource perspective and looking where we can use third-party resources to flex. We're going to have this hybrid approach."
            
            The mix worked well when usage dropped over the summer when online classes concluded and then picked up again in the fall.
            
            To know whether more server capacity is needed, Steckelberg said, she looks at a metric she didn't pay much attention to before the pandemic: concurrent daily meeting attendees. Previously, she looked at daily meeting attendees as a gauge of company performance. But now, she needs to know how many people are video conferencing at the same time.
            
            "It's become more important over the last six months," she said. "It tells us where we're going and what we need to add."
            
            Long-term plan
            The company's biggest challenge lies ahead: staying on a growth trajectory once the pandemic eases and the demand for video conferencing subsides.
            
            After Pfizer in early November announced a 90% success rate with its vaccine in tests, Zoom's stock valuation dropped 17%, a preview of what's to come if it can't show a renewed growth path.
            
            But the company's strategy so far has been reassuring, Koontz said. In one of its biggest moves, it launched Zoom Phone, a kind of PBX system in which calls, whether for work, home or mobile, are routed through a single system and can be converted to a video call. RingCentral is a dominant player in the space, but it might not be for long.
            
            "Maybe Zoom wants to be the king of unified communications and buy RingCentral," he said.
            
            The company has already snapped up RingCentral's former chief sales executive, Ryan Azus, another WebEx alum, suggesting it is keeping a close eye on the company.
            
            Zoom has also been making its core video conferencing business more attractive for a post-pandemic world. Companies have seen how cost- and time-efficient video conferencing can be compared to on-site events, which makes them likely to make virtual events a bigger part of how they operate even while resuming travel.
            
            Zoom's improvements include a partnership with DocuSign to enable contract signings during virtual meetings and the launch of a program called OnZoom, which is intended to increase the attraction of virtual meetings for small businesses. Other initiatives include voiceless check-ins and what Zoom calls its Smart Gallery, a way for employees attending an in-person meeting virtually to feel more a part of the event.
            
            "We're always listening to our customers and learning from them what is the most beneficial to them," Steckelberg said. "As long as we keep focused on that, competition makes us all be better. It's good for the end user."
            
            "I think they're doing the best they can given the circumstances,"
             Koontz said. "Their op ex in the July quarter was up 104% YOY,
              so they doubled in size in a single year, and they're still behind.
               It's pretty incredible what they're trying to pull off."</p>

        <p class="content">Joy Buolamwini got Jeff Bezos to back down.

            In June, Amazon announced that it was issuing a moratorium on police use of its controversial facial recognition software, called Rekognition, which it had sold to law enforcement for years in defiance of privacy advocates. The move marked a remarkable retreat for Amazon’s famously stubborn CEO. And he wasn’t alone. IBM pledged that same week to stop developing facial recognition entirely, and Microsoft committed to withholding its system from police until federal regulations were passed.
            
            These decisions occurred amid widespread international protests over systemic racism, sparked by the killing of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police. But the groundwork had been laid four years earlier, when Joy Buolamwini, then a 25-year-old graduate student at MIT’s Media Lab, began looking into the racial, skin type, and gender disparities embedded in commercially available facial recognition technologies. Her research culminated in two groundbreaking, peer-reviewed studies, published in 2018 and 2019, that revealed how systems from Amazon, IBM, Microsoft, and others were unable to classify darker female faces as accurately as those of white men—effectively shattering the myth of machine neutrality. 
            
            Today, Buolamwini is galvanizing a growing movement to expose the social consequences of artificial intelligence. Through her nearly four-year-old nonprofit, the Algorithmic Justice League (AJL), she has testified before lawmakers at the federal, state, and local levels about the dangers of using facial recognition technologies with no oversight of how they’re created or deployed. Since George Floyd’s death, she has called for a complete halt to police use of face surveillance, and is providing activists with resources and tools to demand regulation. Many companies, such as Clearview AI, are still selling facial analysis to police and government agencies. And many police departments are using facial recognition technologies to identify, in the words of the New York Police Department, individuals that have committed, are committing, or are about to commit crimes. “We already have law enforcement that is imbued with systemic racism,” Buolamwini says. “The last thing we need is for this presumption of guilt of people of color, of Black people, to be confirmed erroneously through an algorithm.” (This isn’t a hypothetical: The ACLU of Michigan recently filed a complaint against the Detroit Police Department on behalf of a man who was wrongly arrested for shoplifting based on incorrect digital image analysis.)

        <p class="content">When I was a college student using A.I.-powered facial detection software for a coding project, the robot I programmed couldn’t detect my dark-skinned face. I had to borrow my white roommate’s face to finish the assignment. Later, working on another project as a graduate student at the M.I.T. Media Lab, I resorted to wearing a white mask to have my presence recognized.

            My experience is a reminder that artificial intelligence, often heralded for its potential to change the world, can actually reinforce bias and exclusion, even when it’s used in the most well-intended ways.
            
            A.I. systems are shaped by the priorities and prejudices — conscious and unconscious — of the people who design them, a phenomenon that I refer to as “the coded gaze.” Research has shown that automated systems that are used to inform decisions about sentencing produce results that are biased against black people and that those used for selecting the targets of online advertising can discriminate based on race and gender.
            
            Specifically, when it comes to algorithmic bias in facial analysis technology — my area of research and one focus of my work with the Algorithmic Justice League — Google’s photo application labeling black people in images as “gorillas” and facial analysis software that works well for white men but less so for everyone else are infamous examples. As disturbing as they are, they do not fully capture the risks of this technology that is increasingly being used in law enforcement, border control, school surveillance and hiring.

            The products of a company called HireVue, which are used by over 600 companies including Nike, Unilever and even Atlanta Public Schools, allow employers to interview job applicants on camera, using A.I. to rate videos of each candidate according to verbal and nonverbal cues. The company’s aim is to reduce bias in hiring.
            
            But there’s a catch: The system’s ratings, according to a Business Insider reporter who tested the software and discussed the results with HireVue’s chief technology officer, reflect the previous preferences of hiring managers. So if more white males with generally homogeneous mannerisms have been hired in the past, it’s possible that algorithms will be trained to favorably rate predominantly fair-skinned, male candidates while penalizing women and people of color who do not exhibit the same verbal and nonverbal cues.
            
            It’s repeatedly been proven that apart from technology, people tend to make hiring decisions favoring white and male candidates, all other things being equal. With this in mind, the instinct to hand the rating of potential employees over to technology is understandable. But how do we know a qualified candidate whose verbal and nonverbal cues tied to age, gender, sexual orientation or race depart from those of the high performers used to train the algorithm will not be scored lower than a similar candidate who more closely resemblesthe in-group? We won’t know if we do not repeatedly test the technology and its application.
            
            The tests that have been done on facial analysis technology raise concerns. In collaboration with the computer vision expert Timnit Gebru, I investigated the accuracy of facial analysis technology from IBM, Microsoft and Face++. On the simple task of guessing the gender of a face, all companies’ technology performed better on male faces than on female faces and especially struggled on the faces of dark-skinned African women. In the worst case, the technology was 34 percent less accurate for those women than it was for white men.

            Given how susceptible facial analysis technology seems to recreating gender and racial bias, companies using HireVue, if they hope to increase fairness, should check their systems to make sure it is not amplifying the biases that informed previous hiring decisions. It’s possible companies using HireVue could someday face lawsuits charging that the program had a negative disparate impact on women and minority applicants, a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.
            
            The risks of biased facial analysis technology extend beyond hiring. According to the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law, the faces of half of all adults in the United States — over 117 million people — are currently in face recognition database networks that can be searched by police departments without warrant. These searches are often reliant on facial recognition technology that hasn’t been tested for accuracy on different groups of people. This matters because misidentification can subject innocent people to police scrutiny or erroneous criminal charges.
            
            In the case of South Wales, where Big Brother Watch reports that between May 2017 and March 2018 the faces of over 2,400 misidentified innocent people were stored by the police department without their consent, the department reported a false-positive facial identification rate of 91 percent. But it’s important to remember that even if false-positive match rates improve, unfair use of facial recognition technology cannot be fixed with a software patch. Even accurate facial recognition can be used in disturbing ways. The Baltimore police department used face recognition technology to identify and arrest people who attended the 2015 protests against police misconduct that followed Freddie Gray’s death in Baltimore.
            
            We need to challenge the growing use of this technology, and there has been some progress on this front. The A.C.L.U. is calling on Amazon to stop selling facial analysis technology to law enforcement and is contesting the use of in-car facial recognition for the Vehicle Face System being tested at the United States-Mexico border. Though lawmakers in Texas, Illinois and California have made legislative efforts to regulate facial recognition technology, there are no federal laws. Yet, there is a blueprint. A 2016 report from Georgetown Law School proposed model federal legislation. Policymakers should embrace it.
            
            We can also learn from international models. Unlike the United States, Canada has a federal statute governing the use of biometric data in the private sector. Companies like Facebook and Amazon must obtain informed consent to collect citizens’ unique face information. In the European Union, Article 9 of the General Data Protection Regulation requires express affirmative consent for collection of biometrics from E.U. citizens.
            
            Everyday people should support lawmakers, activists and public-interest technologists in demanding transparency, equity and accountability in the use of artificial intelligence that governs our lives. Facial recognition is increasingly penetrating our lives, but there is still time to prevent it from worsening social inequalities. To do that, we must face the coded gaze.

        <p class="content">company's first CFO in 2017, he had his sights set on going public and needed an experienced hand to help him prepare for and manage the IPO. He got that. But he also got a former CEO whose experience on the strategic side of running a company made her the ideal partner to manage Zoom's explosive pandemic-led growth.

            "We didn't hire Kelly because we are going to go public," Yuan told the Silicon Valley Business Journal at the time. "It's more to help us grow our business."
            
            Yuan and Steckelberg worked together at WebEx, the video conferencing platform Cisco bought in 2007. For all of WebEx's promise, Yuan said, it was too hard for people to use. That led him and other engineers to leave and build from scratch what they hoped would be a reliable, user-friendly platform: Zoom.

            Steckelberg, who was finance chief and then CEO of dating app Zoosk after she left WebEx, was the natural choice to join her former colleagues.
            
            "Having the opportunity to be CFO at Zoom was something I just couldn't pass up," she said.
            
            For her role managing a company that, because of the pandemic, grew 355% over two quarters and became a household name, Steckelberg is CFO Dive's CFO of the Year.
            
            "Kelly and her team have done a tremendous job," says Ryan Koontz, who follows Zoom as managing director of Rosenblatt Securities. "She's an integral part of the machine there."
            
            Empowering success
            Steckelberg brings two guiding principles to her role as CFO: Employees should think of the company's finances as their own, and they should understand how their role contributes to the company's success.
            
            "If you give employees the opportunity to understand how they fit in, most will rise to the occasion and do everything they can to help," she said. "Everybody wants to participate in the company's financial success."
            
            Steckelberg credits her three years as CEO of Zoosk with giving her organization-wide insight.
            
            "It gave me a much greater understanding of how marketing, engineering, and product development come together," she said. "If we're launching a product, what does that mean for needs that ripple across the whole organization? I'm more able to prompt people to think, if we're adding all this headcount over here, don't we need something on this side as well?"
            
            Zoosk was a popular dating app when Steckelberg joined it as finance chief in 2011, but it ran into trouble while preparing for an IPO in 2014. Its losses were mounting despite having 27 million users and $200 million in revenue.
            
            With critics saying the company was focusing too much on growth at the expense of profitability, the company canceled its IPO and Steckelberg was promoted to CEO. The job forced her to make tough calls, including laying off 15% of the staff and reducing marketing spend.
            
            "Reductions in force are the hardest decisions you have to make," she said.
            
            A key to the company's turnaround was her executive team's decision to change the direction of the product and eliminate features that would decrease its revenue in the short term.
            
            "That was a very difficult decision to make," she said. "It's absolutely counter-intuitive to everything you learn as a finance person. But two years later, our strategy really took hold."
            
            Managing growth
            Zoom was already a high-flying company when she left Zoosk in 2017, but the pandemic supercharged its growth in a way few businesses have experienced.
            
            "It just happened to be they were at the right place at the right time," Koontz said. "They literally accelerated about four years' worth of growth into two quarters. And there aren't too many types of products or services you can sell in the world that can actually produce that. Zoom is a verb now."
            
            Koontz credits Steckelberg and her team with managing the company's meteoric rise with the right mix of short- and long-term investment while executing an aggressive organization-wide hiring plan. The company has grown from about 700 employees to 4,000 in the last three years, and needs more, but the pandemic has slowed hiring.
            
            "I know they paid out bonuses to a lot of employees over the third quarter, during the pandemic, just for the workload these people had to incur because they literally couldn't hire fast enough," Koontz said.
            
            He praised the company's decision to open its two newest R&D centers in Arizona and Pennsylvania rather than in Silicon Valley or other technology hubs. "These are places where you can hire engineers," he said.
            
            The company's decision to add server capacity by partnering with Oracle, rather than building additional in-house data centers, is another smart move, because it provides the kind of flexibility that it can turn on and off as needed in the short-term.
            
            "Their margins took a little bit of a hit because they had to use public cloud instead of building their own infrastructure out in some places," he said. "You can basically order up the level of service you need on an hour-to-hour basis to handle your peak loads, so they're basically using public cloud to handle the peaks and to handle the surges in demand where they just aren't ready with their own infrastructure."
            
            "It gives us the ability to flex up and down as we need to going forward," Steckelberg said. "We're being thoughtful about not getting over-committed from a resource perspective and looking where we can use third-party resources to flex. We're going to have this hybrid approach."
            
            The mix worked well when usage dropped over the summer when online classes concluded and then picked up again in the fall.
            
            To know whether more server capacity is needed, Steckelberg said, she looks at a metric she didn't pay much attention to before the pandemic: concurrent daily meeting attendees. Previously, she looked at daily meeting attendees as a gauge of company performance. But now, she needs to know how many people are video conferencing at the same time.
            
            "It's become more important over the last six months," she said. "It tells us where we're going and what we need to add."
            
            Long-term plan
            The company's biggest challenge lies ahead: staying on a growth trajectory once the pandemic eases and the demand for video conferencing subsides.
            
            After Pfizer in early November announced a 90% success rate with its vaccine in tests, Zoom's stock valuation dropped 17%, a preview of what's to come if it can't show a renewed growth path.
            
            But the company's strategy so far has been reassuring, Koontz said. In one of its biggest moves, it launched Zoom Phone, a kind of PBX system in which calls, whether for work, home or mobile, are routed through a single system and can be converted to a video call. RingCentral is a dominant player in the space, but it might not be for long.
            
            "Maybe Zoom wants to be the king of unified communications and buy RingCentral," he said.
            
            The company has already snapped up RingCentral's former chief sales executive, Ryan Azus, another WebEx alum, suggesting it is keeping a close eye on the company.
            
            Zoom has also been making its core video conferencing business more attractive for a post-pandemic world. Companies have seen how cost- and time-efficient video conferencing can be compared to on-site events, which makes them likely to make virtual events a bigger part of how they operate even while resuming travel.
            
            Zoom's improvements include a partnership with DocuSign to enable contract signings during virtual meetings and the launch of a program called OnZoom, which is intended to increase the attraction of virtual meetings for small businesses. Other initiatives include voiceless check-ins and what Zoom calls its Smart Gallery, a way for employees attending an in-person meeting virtually to feel more a part of the event.
            
            "We're always listening to our customers and learning from them what is the most beneficial to them," Steckelberg said. "As long as we keep focused on that, competition makes us all be better. It's good for the end user."
            
            "I think they're doing the best they can given the circumstances," Koontz said. "Their op ex in the July quarter was up 104% YOY, so they doubled in size in a single year, and they're still behind. It's pretty incredible what they're trying to pull off."

        <p class="content">Business of Business: Black Girls Code is a phenomenal organization. Everything that I know about it is just so inspiring. What you’ve done with it is amazing. But unfortunately, there’s been some terrible news of late and you’ve sort of been ousted from the organization. What do you think this is really all about?

            Kimberly Bryant: Well, you know, I think first of all, I wanted to just clarify for the record that I'm on a paid administrative leave. So I haven't been formally removed from Black Girls Code. But it's really an administrative leave that was placed on me in December, because of some workplace issues around personnel that really prompted some members of the board to opt to do an investigation. And I'm still on hold and waiting for that investigation to occur so that we can move this issue behind us. 
            
            And some of the things that have come out in the press are discussions of negative Glassdoor reviews and allegations of a toxic workplace. What do you make of all of that? 
            
            Like many other nonprofit organizations, as well as for-profit organizations, we transitioned over the last two years in the midst of this pandemic [into becoming] a fully virtual organization. We were not spared the Great Resignation. And I've seen recent reports that say that nonprofits were some of the most damaged and impacted by this Great Resignation that we're seeing in the workforce right now. 
            
            Black Girls code experienced that as well. Most of the people that we hired in 2020, came into the organization at a time when we were fully virtual. We were not interacting and working with each other [in person]. And so many of the workplace and cultural challenges that we had were actually exacerbated because we did not have time to work with each other as a community and really address those things. 
            
            I think what we saw in 2021, those resignations that we experienced, were a result of really an organization that was experiencing rapid growth, and really hyper growth in terms of doubling our staff and having this influx, incredible influx of revenues and support. We were really trying to figure out how to navigate this and coming from a really small grassroots organization, [to having] twice the staff, multigenerational staff, that we have not had to manage before. And like many organizations, we really struggled with making that transition, which really led to a lot of the departures and transitions that we experienced in 2020.
            
            Right. So do you think a lot of these negative perceptions are coming from people who were at the organization for only a short time only experiencing it when it was remote?
            
            I definitely know that when we started to experience some transitions from staff members in the middle of the year last year in 2021, they were [mostly] folks that had joined our organization in the midst of the pandemic. And many of those folks we never even saw us except from behind a computer screen because we did not take our organization back into even a hybrid model in our workplace until October of last year. We started to experience these transitions in June and July of last year. 
            
            So, I very much think that a factor in this national avalanche was new folks coming into our culture, which was already perhaps not as mature as we would like to be, and not as healthy as we wanted it to be as a grassroots nonprofit organization. And seeing some of that friction caused a lot of the atmospheric challenges that we had as an organization, and we actually brought in some professionals to help us with [with that]. 
            
            So I think that as an organization, what we saw was a need to bring in some external resources, which we did in terms of bringing in a cultural strategist, as well as really bringing in an external organization to do a workforce study on our compensation policy and philosophy, as well as bringing in an executive coach to work with our senior leadership team and in our executives — all with a mind to really build this workplace around social equity and justice. And that is the work that we've been doing for the last six months as an organization, in concert with our board of directors. 
            
            "I do think that as the organization has evolved and matured, we're perhaps at a place as a social justice organization, with a mission to teach girls about technology, we have probably transitioned into a need for a bit more advocacy, in terms of our board of directors being more closely aligned with our mission around social justice inequity." 
            And the negative perceptions, just to kind of pin this down a little bit, do you think they come from people just interacting on Slack or over online as opposed to being in person? A lot of interactions are easier to have in person, or they just don’t go as well online.
            
            I can think back to probably some of the best years that I have experienced in the organization, back in 2018 and early 2019, was when as an organization, we were in the trenches doing this work together. So some of my closest work friends and workmates who have been part of the organization, we would spend hours in the office like, “Yes, we were doing a lot of work.” But a lot of that time spent together was not necessarily doing work, it was getting to know each other as people. 
            
            Some of those folks that I work with in our Oakland office in 2018, we created a close familial bond. Those folks actually helped me take my daughter to college when she started in college as a freshman. So, it's those type of work relationships and bonds that, I think, really helped to create a solid foundation, especially when you're doing work like ours, which can be hard, it can be challenging, it can be stressful. 
            
            Now, I don't want to say, “Oh, you have to be friends with everyone that you work with.”  But I think that some of the challenges that we face as an organization, are no different than what we see in many other workplaces around the country, especially at a time like this in the midst of you know, stressful external events, such as the pandemic, and not being able to commune with each other and build that culture that that really creates for a healthy work environment. 
            
            That makes sense. Can you talk a little bit about your relationship with the board? Were there any tensions that were brewing? I did notice you did made a very bold act by turning down a donation from Uber because of the sexual harassment allegations. I mean, that's incredible. But I could see that being a point of contention, possibly.
            
            Well, that event was, I want to say that was in 2017. So we were still very much [in early stages, and did not have the same board structure as now]. We were a fiscally-sponsored organization until right about the middle of 2018. [Later, the group became a 501(c)(3) organization.]
            
            So that issue was not something that created tensions on the board. I do think that as the organization has evolved and matured, we're perhaps at a place as a social justice organization, with a mission to teach girls about technology, we have probably transitioned into a need for a bit more advocacy, in terms of our board of directors being more closely aligned with our mission around social justice inequity.
            
            What I think I saw as a founder is a misalignment in terms of mission and vision and goals as well. Things that we were building this culture on and BGC with those board of directors who started with us in 2018. That really is what is evident now is we're in the midst of this push or pull challenge, if you will, between the board and myself, and not really being in close alignment. 
            
            Yeah, that's unfortunate, and that can create a lot of unnecessary stress and difficulty. But backing up to hopefully a happier note: Why did you decide to found Black Girls Code?
            
            The story of Black Girls Code, and it is my story: It was founded in 2011, primarily because my daughter was going into middle school and really starting to develop this keen interest in computer science and technology. She is and was an avid gamer. And so when we were looking for ways to really get her to learn these tools of how to become a technologist, when I looked around, and we live in the Bay Area, I didn't find many organizations that were really doing a lot of work with girls of color. There was more of an adult coding movement, a learn-to-code movement, and it was slowly starting to transition into a learn-to-code movement for young people and kids. 
            
            And in many of the events and activities that I was able to get my daughter involved in, I found that those rooms were very-male centric, so lots of little boys and very few little girls, very few students of color. And so this idea, if you will, for Black Girls Code really evolved around my need and my desire as a mother to have my daughter be able to find her tribe and interact with other girls, and be able to feel like she belonged in the spaces. 
            
            And so BGC started with a very small pilot group of like six girls that would meet together on the weekends. And that's how BGC started. And so it was not originally my intention for this to be more of a global movement. It was more a desire to bring a group of girls together with my daughter and teach them the skills that I have learned so many years before in college, and it really just grew much further than I could ever have imagined. 
            
            "I am still very hopeful that we will be able to resolve the situation with the board of directors as soon as possible. I'm still very hopeful that that will be the case that I do believe that I still have work to do at Black Girls Code." 
            Amazing. Were there any major challenges that you had to face in growing this organization or founding it? 
            
            Of course, I think, you know, the Uber story that you mentioned, brings up a really good part of some of the lessons learned along this journey. So when I founded Black Girls Code, I literally started with my savings that were put in my 401(k). You know, I had just left my corporate employer, started out on my own doing some independent consulting, thinking that I would start my own for-profit company. I just didn't want to be in Corporate America anymore. And I was going out on my own. And I kind of stumbled across this need. But I didn't have any outside funding sources. I didn't really have a desire to create a nonprofit. 
            
            So it was really my 401(k) that started this work. And for I will say the first year and a half, I was still working full time as a consultant at the same time I was working with Black Girls Code. It just became so intensive that I decided to leave. I had interns, employees and interns that were working for free. And I was like, it would be great if I could pay this one intern something. So I was like, “Let me leave and try to take off for the summer to raise funding, and then I'll go back to work. But I'll have enough to pay this one employee.” 
            
            One of the things that's been challenging for the past 10 years is being in high demand but under-resourced. A lot of I think, some of the feedback that we've gotten from my team, but also our experiences is that until 2020 like we really were working with less staff than we needed, less resources and needed, and less equipment than we needed. We literally in 2021 just started to buy the staff  new laptops. You and I were having a problem getting online to do this interview because I'm still on my old laptop. I haven't updated mine. But we didn't have resources to do this work, even though we had this exponential demand.
            
            I've done the mail, I've been to the bank to do bank deposits, I do payroll, I've done five jobs. And so have many, many of the other team members. So I think the biggest challenge that we faced over the last 10 years is just being so terribly under-resourced, even in the face of such demand for what we do and such excitement for the work that we do. 
            
            It wasn’t until 2020 When we started to get this support coming in in wake of the George Floyd protests and such that we finally started to have adequate resources to both build and hire a team, and build our systems, like our Salesforce. We didn't have resources to do that before. And so that is probably been the biggest challenge, which is why that Uber event was so significant for back in 2017, the notion of us turning down a six figure grant was significant, because that was really like one of the biggest grants we had received at that point.
            
            "I think it puts a tremendous weight on the founder or the person in the lead to carry the ship all by themselves. And that puts a lot of stress on the organization as well." 
            So I think that has been the biggest challenge. And I think on top of that, for me, as a founder leading alone at the top, without really having a team, a leadership team, is something that I would never suggest to any other founders. Like, it's not the way to build. It is the way I built, but I don't suggest it, because I think it puts a tremendous weight on the founder or the person in the lead to carry the ship all by themselves. And that puts a lot of stress on the organization as well. The leader is really not equipped to do all of those things, run the operations, get the mail. Like it’s just not tenable over a long period. If I had to do it over again, I think those are the two things that I would really reconsider.
            
            Absolutely, bandwidth is only so much for every person. What made you want to code? And what kind of barriers and challenges did you face as a Black woman in an industry where there clearly are not enough Black women?
            
            Yeah, so it's interesting how I started my journey. I'm an electrical engineer, by training with a master’s and bachelor's in electrical engineering and a minor in computer science. So when I was going to get my bachelor's degrees back in the middle of the 80s, it was really more women receiving bachelor’s degrees in computer science than there are today. It didn't seem that way, though. It was right in the middle of the 80s. When Web1.0 was just starting to emerge. And that's a fact. You know, I mean, I'm not that much older, if you will, like I was at the beginning of this movement. 
            
            And so I think for me, I was really intrigued by technology. So my very first class was, you know, learning how to code in Fortran, which my daughter will look at me like I’m crazy if I say I used Fortran. But that's what I learned. And I think for me, it was just really this new thing “www.” I remember vividly, like, seriously, like being in my first job, and actually, one of my peers saying, like, “Hey, there's this new thing called the internet. And if you type in www…”, and then I think we had a very long list of numbers that we have to type in and get into the internet. That was real. And it was just like a new world emerged at that time.
            
            And so for me, I think it was just this notion of this was the new frontier. I remember the earliest Apple Macintosh computers, and how excited we were to actually have something like that we could take home. So I think for me, it was just that piece of learning something new, and being on the forefront of this emerging industry that was just starting to unfold. I think I still feel the excitement of something new that I experienced back in the mid-80s. And getting on the internet I get the same type of excitement, and I’m really starting to dip into Web3, and get my feet wet on crypto and NFTs and exploring that world, the blockchain. I think we're still at another stage, really going into the next generation of what the internet will be. 
            
            So where do things go from here for you with regard to this investigation? And you know, what, what happens if you can't come back to Black Girls Code? What will you do?
            
            Well, I am still very hopeful that we will be able to resolve the situation with the board of directors as soon as possible. I'm still very hopeful that that will be the case. I do believe that I still have work to do at Black Girls Code. I'm not one of those founders that intends to be in my organization for 20 or 30 years. But I do have some work that I need to get done. You know, there is still a foundation that I hope to leave with my organization, and there is succession planning that I hope to complete. And I absolutely do intend to be part of my board of directors for many years to come. 
            
            But I think after that, the situation has really opened my eyes to how issues like this are more common than they are rare. Over the last few weeks, I've had probably 20 or 30 individuals, mostly women, many women of color, that have come to me with stories very similar to mine. And in the midst of doing my work, I wasn't even aware that this sort of thing happened. I think, like many nonprofit founders that start in this industry without a lot of experience, we were unaware of some of the gaps and challenges around nonprofit governance and the model itself. 
            
            And so for me, part of what I want to do in the future is really lean into advocacy. I think, you know, in 2020, there certainly was this rush to support organizations and, and founders of color, but there's still a gap when we look at these models and structures of leadership and power, that often tend to disenfranchise women, especially women, once they're in a leadership role. And I feel very privileged, even in the midst of I want to say this storm, I feel extremely privileged, because I do have a platform.
            
            "There are other women who experienced this type of injustice, if you will. I'll just call it as I see it. And they can't speak on it, or if they can, they don't have the platform that I have." 
            There are other women who experienced this type of injustice, if you will. I'll just call it as I see it. And they can’t speak on it, or if they can, they don’t have the platform that I have. And I feel that it's important for me to use the privilege that I have gained to become a voice for others, to create support systems for other women in leadership, to share my story to other women, so they don't make the mistakes that I made — so I can share with them how they can create strong governance models within their organizations that protects the vision of the organization as well as themselves and what they have built, and they have a lasting legacy. So this advocacy work will be very much a part of what I do in the future, and think, and then I think beyond that, it's like really taking the work that I've done over the last 10 years with BGC to the next level. I do want to do more in the tech industry. I do want to lean into Web3, and I do want to do work that empowers other women to build.

        <p class="content">“Hey, Class of 2021, I’m incredibly proud to be your commencement speaker.

            Thank you, Morty [Schapiro] for inviting me, and thanks to the board and Lanny Martin, its chairman, for allowing me to speak, even though you guys know me for my six years of service on this board, and that this invitation is a tiny bit risky.
            
            But it is an honor to follow in Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s steps. Last year she brought gravitas to this event, while she honored George Floyd and implored graduates to participate in our democracy.
            
            This is a special year to do the Northwestern University commencement. This is my 35th anniversary of my Northwestern University undergraduate commencement, and most importantly, Stephen Colbert, who also graduated from NU – or almost did – in 1986, did this speech exactly 10 years ago, and he predicted that the speaker for 2021 would be, and I quote, ‘a zoo parrot with a mortar board that has been trained to say congratulations.’ So here I am, Gwynne Shotwell, your zoo parrot, for the class of ’21; congratulations to you.
            
            Class of ’21, you have achieved something important. All graduations deserve a celebration but you, this class of 2021, have an even greater achievement: You not only survived but succeeded throughout the insanity of 2020 and into this year. You were able to focus and invest in your future during a period of immense suffering.
            
            But many of the issues that we face going forward will be different. I think highly dynamic social, political and economic situations are the new normal, and you are now better prepared to succeed in them. You have lived it and not just survived, but succeeded. Feel good about that and carry that new skill with you; I think you will use it.
            
            Okay, before I share a few jewels of my life lessons learned, there are a few things you should know about me to help put my remarks in context. I am a mother, a wife, a mechanical engineer, and nerd. We aren’t all nerds, but I’m proud to be one. I’m a longtime SpaceX employee and leader, an active listener, a rancher, of course a wildcat, and an aspiring winemaker. I love my country, even though it is flawed and I’m committed to helping resolve its social injustices. And I am desperate to be a grandmother, but my children aren’t cooperating in my vision, at least yet.
            
            My road to Northwestern started in Libertyville, Illinois, which is a small town north of the university – that’s where I grew up. I did very well in elementary and high school academics, and I also worked incredibly hard at having a full social life. I decided to be a mechanical engineer, after my mother took me to a Society of Women Engineers event when I was only 15 or 16. I applied only to Northwestern University School of Engineering. But it wasn’t because it was the best engineering school – I applied because of Northwestern’s richness in other fields. It was ranked among the top, or was the top at that time. This was important to me because as a teenage girl in the late ’70s – yep, I’m that old – I was terrified as being tagged as a nerd. Now I’m super proud to be one.
            
            I was accepted by Northwestern – I’m not sure I would be today, so I think I timed that properly – and I completed two degrees from this fine institution, a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering and a master’s degree in applied math. Though I criticize my engineering education as too theoretical. I think the best engineers are those that can put the theoretical to practice, and I got almost no practice as an undergrad. Northwestern highlighted the criticality of broad-based thinking. Just being good in math and science will not drive success. It’s whole-brain thinking brought to practice that does. I’m thankful that Dean Ottino has brought a strong focus of this concept and applied it so well here to Northwestern engineering.
            
            As I was building my own foundation in engineering, I also found time to build a family. I gave birth to and raised two extraordinary children who are better people than I, and could be president of the universe, rather than just being president of SpaceX. One is a double alum in mechanical engineering from Northwestern and one will be a double alum from Stanford, both in mechanical engineering and business. As a mother giving advice to potential future parents: Never tell your children what they should be when they grow up – they will in fact do the opposite. But you can be a good role model, or show them good role models, as my mother did for me – she was an artist.
            
            For the last nearly 19 years I have worked for one of, if not the, finest physicist and engineer, Elon Musk. He gave me the opportunity to help him grow SpaceX from 10 people to nearly 10,000 people, and from zero revenue to billions annually. I have helped bring the commercial launch business back to this country, along with the tens of thousands of jobs that come with it. The one accomplishment that we have that I am most proud of is helping to get our country flying astronauts again on American-made rockets and spaceships. We are now positioned to fly astronauts from all over the world on our Dragon spaceship and later this year we will fly the first all-civilian mission, where regular everyday people will travel to space on a multi-day journey around Earth. And this is just the beginning.
            
            I hope that I have helped create a path that allows humans to live on Earth, the moon or Mars, whichever their choice. I hope for a future where people can live even further out, amongst other star systems and galaxies. I often joke about wanting to meet other people and see otherworldly fashion. I know I won’t see that in my lifetime, but I hope that my work serves as a foundation or a small beginning to achieve that.
            
            Okay, so now that you know more about me, it’s time to share some advice. I’ll name three and then I’ll go back and talk about them. Set and try to achieve absolutely absurd goals, and don’t be afraid of failing, if you can’t achieve them. Work hard, really hard, and be helpful. Be kind, but at minimum, be respectful. Don’t be afraid to admit that if you fail, you were wrong and take a different path – or better yet, don’t even consider trying something and not getting the outcome that you want as failure. Consider it growth.
            
            When I was considering joining SpaceX back in 2002 I was struggling with a decision and drawing it out for weeks. It seemed so risky for me personally to join this little start-up, in an industry where none had ever succeeded. At the time I was a part-time single mother, and this was just too far out of my comfort zone. I was driving on the freeway here in L.A. when it finally hit me: I was being a total idiot. Who cares if I tried this job and either I failed or the company failed? What I recognized at that moment was that it was the trying part that was the most important. Try that risky thing, be a part of something exciting. I don’t want to imagine what my life and career would be like had I said no. I’m sure I would have been fine but I would not have been a part of this amazing company, working alongside such extraordinary people. Not taking that job would have been the fail.
            
            On a business level, SpaceX took massive reputational risks, mastering the technology and operations associated with landing a rocket. In fact we were continually criticized by our competitors and the media for these failures. I looked on these failures as a source of pride. Our very first attempt to land the rocket on a drone ship, we hit it. We didn’t land on it, but we hit the drone ship – that tiny target was hundreds of miles away from the launch site in a vast ocean. After about a dozen attempts we finally succeeded in landing that rocket and landing rockets has become almost routine for us. Still tricky, but it’s almost routine. And that technology has been enormously helpful to our business and is critical to establishing a settlement on Mars. If you can’t land the rocket, you can’t get people to the surface.
            
            Working hard and being helpful. I was hired as vice president of business development – that means head of sales. Well I did my job and we got customers, but then their missions needed to be managed and we needed an accounting and finance function because we actually were bringing in money, we needed to work closely with the launch ranges and get permission to be able to launch from them, so I took that on as well. And, as we demonstrated success, we needed a government affairs function to play defense for us in D.C., as our competitor started fighting us. I remember even vacuuming the carpets before a big customer event. In 2008, when we won our biggest contract to date – a nearly $2 billion effort from NASA to take science experiments and cargo to-and-from the International Space Station – Elon needed a partner, and he asked me to do it. I think it was in large part because I had kept growing my scope, being helpful in other areas to the company, all trying to do a great job.
            
            Being kind, but at minimum, you must be respectful. Note that almost everyone that you interact with every day is battling some demon or trying to get through some issue. Please consider this as you battle your way to work on the subway, as you’re hurrying through the lines at the grocery store, or as you get frustrated with someone in a meeting at work.
            
            At SpaceX we have a ‘no a------’ policy. These kinds of people – a------ – interrupt others, they shut down or co-opt conversation, and they create a hostile environment where no one wants to contribute. This is not a way to promote sharing good, innovative, and even outrageous ideas that are required to solve hard problems. In short, the best way to find solutions to hard problems is to listen harder, not talk louder. Embrace the ideas of your fellow workers, especially when they differ greatly from yours.
            
            Stuff that I’m not sharing lessons on but that I think are really important, especially to talk about in a commencement speech in 2021. I’m worried about a lot of things, but I’m not knowledgeable enough in these things to have any useful advice for you, at least not yet. However, I cannot in a commencement speech in 2021 fail to mention the things that I worry about knowing, that many are problems I want to help tackle in the future.
            
            I’m worried about our nation’s children. We are not giving all of our children an education that will shape them into resourceful and productive people that our country needs to remain relevant. Every child is a resource to better our future, and our future will be driven by technology. That is why I am so concerned about the science and math test scores that we have in this country. China scores first. Ireland – I just bring this up because it’s what my heritage is, my ancestors are from Ireland – scores 12th, and the United States ranks 25th.
            
            Worse than that, if there is a worse than scoring 25th in math and science as well as reading, is that the gap between our lowest scoring students and our highest scoring students is widening. We are not preparing our children for their future.
            
            I love this country and I’m worried about the widening, economic, social and racial divide which was amplified during the pandemic. Not addressing education for our youth is not helping that. We are not treating our neighbors with the respect that they deserve. We are not listening hard to each other and respectfully working on the really important issues that we face as a country and as a human race.
            
            I haven’t helped our country work on these issues yet – I whine a lot about it – and it’s time, probably in the very near term, for me to commit and help fix them. Maybe we can work on these things together.
            
            So I’ve given you some actual experience that taught me that more can be accomplished when crazy ideas are respected, listened to and evaluated. That being helpful and hardworking pays off; it did for me. And that wasting resources, especially human capital, is a moral and ethical sin. And that a small group of people, like those of us here at SpaceX, can change an industry, and by extension can help change the world.
            
            Growing up and even early in my career, my friends, colleagues and I focused on getting ahead with an aside or maybe even an afterthought that maybe we should do something good for the world. But as I accumulate more life’s lessons, it’s clear that a far richer life results from switching that up, finding a career where your pursuit of a better world leads to your getting ahead. And all of you have in you right now all that you need to start your pursuit of a better world. Congratulations, and Godspeed.”</p>

        <p class="content">For Dave Goldberg, May 1, 2015, was the best day with the worst ending. The Survey­Monkey CEO was celebrating the 50th birthday of one of his closest buddies at a palm-fringed, $12,750-a-night, nine-bedroom villa in Punta Mita, a secluded Mexican resort favored by the Silicon Valley elite. The vacation had been full of what he loved: games with family and friends, walks and long talks by the pool. When he climbed on the fitness-center treadmill that Friday, nothing but blue sky appeared ahead: his company was doing well, his children were healthy, and he was as in love as ever with his superwoman wife Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s COO and the author of Lean In. Then his heart gave out.

            Goldberg—Goldie to his friends—was only 47 when his younger brother Rob, Rob’s wife and Sandberg found him lying in a halo of blood, his skin blue. “I started doing CPR,” says Rob. “I remember not being sure if I could feel a pulse or if it was really my own heart pounding.” Goldberg was rushed to San Javier Hospital, a dimly lit medical center. Sandberg and one of her best friends, Marne Levine, sat on the linoleum floor waiting for a doctor to give them the news they didn’t want.
            
            
            In short order—though she says it felt agonizingly slow—Sandberg, the complex-problem solver, the micro­manager, the person with an almost freakish understanding of how to arrive at the best possible results, was thrust against something un­familiar: an outcome she couldn’t change. “The wails of her crying in that hospital were unlike anything that I’d ever heard in my life,” says Phil Deutch, Levine’s husband and the person whose birthday they were celebrating. “It was an awful, awful scene.”
            
            As they were leaving Goldberg’s body for the last time, Sandberg ran back to give him one more hug. “I think for Sheryl, letting go of him physically meant letting go of the moment that this could somehow not be real,” says Rob. “I had to gently pull her off of him. She just wanted to hug him and wanted him to be there and wanted him to come back.”

            Dying is not a technical glitch of the human operating system; it’s a feature. It’s the only prediction we can make at birth that we can bank on. Everyone will die, and it’s very likely somebody we love will die before we do. And yet the bereaved are often treated like those to whom something unnatural or disgraceful has happened. People avoid them, don’t invite them out, fall silent when they enter the room. The grieving are often isolated when they most need community.
            
            That’s a problem that Sandberg, now 47, can work with. The woman who urged the world to lean in is now under­taking a campaign to help people push on, to bounce back from horrible misfortune. Her newest book, Option B: Facing Adversity, Building Resilience, and Finding Joy, is a primer for those who are bereaved, to help them recover and find happiness. But it’s also a guide for the unscathed on how to help people “lean in to the suck,” as Sandberg’s rabbi puts it.
            
            She wrote the book with her friend and collaborator Adam Grant, a psychologist and the author of the best sellers Originals and Give and Take. Like Lean In, Option B comes with a nonprofit launched by the Sheryl Sandberg & Dave Goldberg Family Foundation. The organization aims to “change the conversation around adversity,” Sandberg’s representatives say. If that seems vague, recall that nobody really knew what the Lean In Circles were supposed to do either—but there are now 30,000 of them in 150 countries.
            
            Some might argue that Sandberg is the wrong teacher for a course in hard knocks. After all, her life, from the outside, seems a mind-bogglingly privileged existence among brainiac titans. She’s a billionaire in no danger of losing her job, no matter how much time she takes off. She can afford round-the-clock therapy, and her network can put her in touch with anyone.
            
            Sandberg is well aware of her advantages. (And in case she needed a reminder, just last month, author Camille Paglia called her “insufferably smug and entitled.”) But she has deployed a disadvantage as her ultimate asset: vulnerability. In June 2015, a month into her widowhood, after a particularly lousy day, Sandberg posted on Facebook the social-­media equivalent of Edvard Munch’s Scream. “I think when tragedy occurs, it presents a choice,” she wrote. “You can give in to the void, the emptiness that fills your heart, your lungs, constricts your ability to think or even breathe. Or you can try to find meaning. These past 30 days, I have spent many of my moments lost in that void.” Suddenly, Superwoman became very human.
            
            Except because she is the kind of person who always has at hand a Ziploc bag filled with exactly the right number of macadamia nuts, Sandberg’s howl into the void came with helpful tips. Don’t avoid the heartbroken (except when they obviously want to be avoided). Don’t tell them that every­thing will be O.K. because, well, how would you know? And don’t ask the bereaved how they are. Instead ask them how they are that day.

            None of the advice in the post or in the book is particularly new. Grief is not a novel problem. But not very many folks with Sandberg’s platform and pain have talked about it, with the intent of starting a movement. “She was able to find some gratitude,” says Grant, “and really think about how she could share the experience she had in a way that would help other people.”
            
            Sandberg’s 2015 post has now drawn almost 75,000 comments, including ones from Facebook employees who didn’t know how to react to their famous boss, who occasionally broke down in tears in a meeting—which, as Sandberg writes, is not the kind of disruption Silicon Valley is looking for.
            
            “I think a lot of people wanted to reach out to her, but they didn’t know how,” says Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. “You know, there’s this whole question of, Are you reopening a wound or something? And of course, what she would say is ‘You’re not reopening the wound. I mean, it’s, like, open and gaping.’”
            
            A month before Goldberg died, Tracy Zamot, a music publicist in New York, also lost her husband suddenly, of a pulmonary embolism. She says Sandberg’s post had a real effect on the way people talked to her. “The minute she wrote, ‘How are you today?’ people started asking me that,” she says, which made answering the question much easier. “I didn’t feel like I was going to explode into a ball of flames every time I had to answer.”
            
            Sandberg claims that she shared her feelings on impulse, but the response pushed her to action. “I got so much of this wrong, so much of this wrong,” she says in her glass-walled conference room, which is identified by a small plaque near the door that reads, ONLY GOOD NEWS.

            To Grant, a Wharton School professor, Sandberg has made a contribution not just to self-help but also to leadership. “I would like more leaders to realize what Sheryl did through living it,” he says. “Expressing emotion when you’ve gone through extreme pain is not weakness. It is humanity.”
            
            In the weeks after Goldberg died, even before she posted on Facebook, Sandberg had been codifying her agony in a journal and sharing it with a few close confidantes. “I wrote and I wrote and I wrote,” she says. Keeping a journal is one of the activities she recommends to ease the grieving process. “Literally all I did was my kids, come to work and write.” The 100,000-plus words she eventually wrote were a big part of her recovery and became the spine of her book.
            
            What Sandberg learned, with the help of Grant, was that there are three myths people cling to that make it harder to spring back from adversity. The first is that they’re somehow responsible for what happened to them. The second is that sadness must carpet their lives from wall to wall. And the third is that they will never feel any better. Ever the communicator, Sandberg calls these mistakes the three p’s: thinking about adversity as personal, pervasive and permanent.
            
            The lessons, which she says she wishes she knew when her first marriage ended in divorce, didn’t come easily. Grant told Sandberg she had to ban the word sorry. “Sheryl likes to ban things that are not productive, like #ban­bossy,” he says, citing Sandberg’s campaign to stop using a word about girls that is never used to describe boys. “There’s no more effective way to argue with someone who’s strong-willed than to turn their own words around on them.”
            
            Her tendency to apologize was the result of an unexpected symptom of her grief: Sandberg completely lost her self-­confidence. “It just kind of crumbled in every area,” she says. “I didn’t think I could be a good friend. I didn’t feel like I could do my job.” She wasn’t even sure she could look after her grieving kids. This surprised Sandberg as much as anyone: “It reminded me of how one day in my neighborhood I watched a house that had taken years to build get torn down in a matter of minutes,” she writes in Option B. “Boom. Flattened.”
            
            On her first day back at work, she says, she fell asleep in a meeting, rambled and misidentified a colleague, then left at 2 p.m. to pick up her kids from school. That evening she called Zuckerberg to see if she should even be there. “Mark said, ‘Take the time off you need,’” says Sandberg. “And that’s what I would have said to someone in the same situation. But then he said, ‘Actually I’m really glad you were here today. You made two really good points—here’s what they were.’”
            
            That small vote of confidence led to one of the biggest changes Sandberg made in her management style: she no longer automatically diverts work from people facing personal adversity. Now she asks if they want to do it because, counter­intuitively, relieving people of some of their responsibilities could mean denying them a way of finding their bearings.
            
            
            When Caryn Marooney was diagnosed with breast cancer shortly after she was asked to head up global communications at Facebook, Sandberg encouraged her to take the promotion. “Sheryl had been a vulnerable leader that I had gotten to see close up,” says Marooney. She took the job, and in one of her first meetings with her team members she let them know she was undergoing treatment. “It helped people share things with me in a way that helped me understand how to do the job better and faster,” Marooney says.
            
            Silicon Valley wasn’t all so gentle and touchy-feely. Another friend, venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, told Sandberg to remember her ambition and “get back on the mother­f-cking path.” He also gave her a chain to wear Goldberg’s wedding band around her neck. (Zuckerberg had also given her a chain, so Sandberg—half empath, half Spock—had them welded together at the ends and wears both.)
            
            Over time, Sandberg began to emerge from the fog. Her mom didn’t have to lie beside her every night as she cried herself to sleep. She danced at a party and felt momentarily happy. She didn’t travel as much or have as many work dinners, but she got out. She started playing the piano again after 30 years and created new rituals with her kids: they started biking and have weekly “family awesome fun,” where one child chooses an activity. She also lets the kids have sleepovers, which Goldberg, who thought his kids, now 9 and 12, needed sleep, had not allowed.
            
            Encouraged by her in-laws, Sandberg eventually started dating too. Her current beau is Bobby Kotick, who runs the gaming company Activision Blizzard and comes from the same brand of mensch as Goldberg. She has replaced the photo of a beach at dusk in her bedroom with one of a beach during the day. She’s even taken back birthdays. First she started celebrating her own, which she used to do only every five years.
            “She embraces joy in a different way than she has before,” says friend Levine. “She tries to make her birthdays as joyful as possible.” On Goldberg’s birthday, the kids play poker, his favorite game, in which they are being coached by Palihapitiya, who has competed in the World Series of Poker championships.
            
            She even had a party for Deutch, whose birthday will forever be associated with Goldberg’s death. “You know, it’s never going to be the same,” Deutch says, “but she really went to great efforts to help take a day that’s pretty dark and change it.”
            
            Sandberg, too, is changed. “I think she just has more perspective,” says Zuckerberg. When he first got the message from her on that Friday night that said “Urgent, please call,” he thought it was probably a work issue, even though she was on vacation. “A lot of things used to be ‘Urgent, please call,’” he says. “These days they’re not. But I think that that’s made her a better leader.” For her part, Sandberg says, “Mark’s one of the people who really carried me. I believe even more I work with the greatest person in the world.”
            
            Sandberg has faced adversity, developed resilience and found some joy. But what she can’t do anything about—what still makes her lower the remote-­controlled blinds in her meeting room at work and weep every time she talks about it—is the fact that she cannot give her kids their father back.
            
            Telling them he was gone was the hardest thing she has ever done. She avoids talking about it, but in Option B she writes that “nothing has come close to the pain of this moment. Even now when my mind wanders back, I shake and my throat constricts.”
            
            The difficulties of being a single mother, even a highly resourced one, came as a shock to Sandberg. They made her rethink some of Lean In. “When I look back at the chapter called ‘Make Your Partner a Real Partner,’ it has, like, a big old assumption that you have a partner,” she says. “I got that wrong.”
            
            
            Charles Ommanney—Facebook
            In the wake of Sandberg’s loss, she and Zuckerberg changed Facebook’s leave policies
            Almost 10 million women are single mothers in the U.S., and about one-third of those households live in ­poverty—something that enrages Sandberg. “I think it��s part of why I have become so outspoken on public policy now,” she says. “I’m in a different place.”
            
            On Father’s Day, she and her children went to a camp for kids whose dads are incarcerated. And in April, she promoted a campaign to draw attention to the gender pay gap by persuading businesses to charge 20% less for a day.
            
            She wants to see changes in maternity leave, paternity leave and living-wage laws. But she’s even less inclined than she was before Goldberg died to enter public office—partly because her focus is on her kids and partly because she feels she can move the needle more effectively from where she is. “My loyalty to Mark was deep before and is deeper now,” she says. Facebook recently implemented a slew of new bereavement and family-illness leave policies, which she hopes will pressure other tech companies to follow suit.
            
            But the more mundane stuff breaks her heart too. “Does there have to be a father-daughter dance?” she asks. “My kids will say things like ‘You’re the only parent I have left.’ Or my daughter has been talking about how she doesn’t remember her father, his voice. She said, ‘I’m glad I have video, because I didn’t think his voice sounded like that.’” The remote-controlled blinds come down. “I feel it every day. Every day. I go to my son’s basketball game, and there are a lot of fathers there. My daughter is going to be in the school play next week, and Dave is not here to go to any of that.”
            
            A few weeks after Goldberg died, there was a father-child event at the kids’ school, and Deutch proposed designating a stand-in dad. Sandberg protested that it wasn’t the same as having Goldberg there. Deutch put his arm around her. “Option A is not available,” he said. “So let’s just kick the shit out of Option B.”
